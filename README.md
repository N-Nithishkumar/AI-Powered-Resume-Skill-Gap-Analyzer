# 🧠 AI-Powered Resume Skill Gap Analyzer

An intelligent machine learning system that analyzes a candidate’s **resume** against a **target job role** and predicts **skill match percentage**, **missing skills**, and a **personalized learning roadmap** using NLP and semantic similarity.

Built to move beyond traditional ATS systems and provide **actionable career guidance** instead of simple rejection.

# 📌 Project Overview

Given a candidate’s resume and a selected job role, the system :

1. Extracts skills from the resume using NLP techniques.
2. Understands **semantic meaning** of skills instead of keyword matching.
3. Compares resume skills with role-specific requirements.
4. Calculates a **skill match percentage**.
5. Identifies **missing and weak skills**.
6. Generates a **personalized upskilling roadmap**.
